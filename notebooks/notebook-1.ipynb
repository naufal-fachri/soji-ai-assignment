    "# Airworthiness Directive (AD) Applicability Parser\n",
    "\n",
    "Determining whether an aircraft is affected by an Airworthiness Directive (AD) requires engineers to manually cross-reference each AD document against fleet data — checking aircraft model, MSN, embodied modifications, and incorporated service bulletins. This process is time-consuming, error-prone, and does not scale as the number of ADs and fleet size grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key challenge is that **AD document layouts are not standardized and evolve over time**. Different issuing authorities (EASA, FAA, etc.) use varying formats, and even within the same authority, the structure changes across revisions. This makes traditional rule-based extraction using regex or template matching impractical — any hard-coded parsing logic would break as soon as the layout shifts, requiring constant maintenance with no guarantee of reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Proposed Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this, we leverage LLMs for the extraction layer, as they can interpret unstructured regulatory text regardless of layout changes. Two implementation approaches are proposed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Full LLM Extraction (Multimodal)** — The AD document (PDF) is sent directly to a multimodal LLM that processes both text and visual layout. This is simpler to implement and preserves the original document structure, including tables and formatting that may carry semantic meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Local OCR + LLM (Text-Only)** — The document is first processed through a local OCR pipeline (e.g., PaddleOCR) to extract raw text, which is then fed to a text-only LLM for structured extraction. This offers more control over preprocessing, reduces multimodal API costs, and can run partially offline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both approaches output structured JSON conforming to a Pydantic schema that captures the full AD structure: applicable models, MSN constraints, modification/SB exclusions, aircraft group definitions, and every required action paragraph with its compliance deadlines.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applicability Engine\n",
    "\n",
    "Once parsed into structured JSON, a deterministic rule-based engine evaluates each aircraft against the extracted data through three sequential checks: **(1) Model Check** — is the aircraft's model listed in the AD's applicability; **(2) MSN Check** — does the serial number satisfy the AD's MSN constraints (all-MSN, ranges, specific lists, exclusions); **(3) Modification/SB Exclusion Check** — has the aircraft already embodied a modification or SB that exempts it. The output is an augmented fleet DataFrame with status indicators: `✅ Affected`, `❌ Not applicable`, or `❌ Not Affected` (exempted).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The LLM handles what regex cannot — understanding unstructured, evolving document formats — while the applicability logic remains fully deterministic and auditable. The \"decision\" layer never hallucinates; it only operates on structured data that can be reviewed before any determination is made. This separation ensures traceability, which is critical for aviation regulatory compliance."

    "Component 1: LLM-Based AD Document Parser\n",
    "\n",
    "The first component uses a large language model (LLM) guided by a carefully engineered system prompt to extract structured data from unstructured AD documents. The system prompt enforces strict extraction rules — the model must only extract explicitly stated information, preserve all identifiers verbatim (model designations, Service Bulletin numbers, modification numbers, MSNs), and output valid JSON conforming to a predefined Pydantic schema. Critical distinctions are enforced at the prompt level: Airbus modification numbers (e.g., `mod 24591`) are always routed to `modification_constraints` and never confused with Service Bulletin identifiers (e.g., `A320-57-1089`), which are routed to `sb_constraints`. This separation is essential because modifications and service bulletins have fundamentally different implications for AD applicability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output schema (`ADApplicabilityExtraction`) captures the full structure of an AD, including: the AD identifier and metadata (issuing authority, effective date, revision history), the complete list of applicable aircraft models and MSN constraints, modification and service bulletin exclusions, aircraft group definitions (which partition the fleet into subsets with different compliance requirements), and every numbered required action paragraph — each annotated with its action type, compliance deadlines, recurring intervals, reference documents, and cross-references to other paragraphs (e.g., corrective actions triggered by inspection findings, or terminating actions that end repetitive requirements).\n",
    "\n",
    "Component 2: Rule-Based Applicability Engine\n",
    "\n",
    "The second component (`compare_to_ad`) takes a fleet inventory DataFrame — containing each aircraft's model, MSN, and applied modifications — and evaluates it against the parsed AD data. For each aircraft-AD pair, the engine performs a three-stage check:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model Check** — Verifies whether the aircraft's type certificate model appears in the AD's applicability list.\n",
    "2. **MSN Check** — Evaluates whether the aircraft's serial number falls within the AD's MSN constraints, supporting `all MSN` declarations, numeric ranges with configurable inclusivity bounds, specific MSN lists, and exclusion logic.\n",
    "3. **Modification/SB Exclusion Check** — Determines whether any modification or service bulletin already embodied on the aircraft exempts it from the AD's scope, using regex-based identifier matching against the parsed constraint data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output is an augmented DataFrame where each AD column contains a status indicator: `✅ Affected` (the aircraft is subject to the AD), `❌ Not applicable` (the aircraft does not meet the AD's applicability criteria), or `❌ Not Affected` (the aircraft originally fell within scope but is exempted by an already-embodied modification or service bulletin)."

    "# Written Report: AD Document Extraction System\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "My pipeline follows a two-stage architecture: **Local OCR (PaddleOCR) → LLM (text-only)** for extraction, followed by a **deterministic rule-based engine** for applicability evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea is straightforward — OCR converts the PDF into raw text, the LLM parses that text into structured JSON, and a rule engine checks each aircraft against the parsed data. I chose this over a pure regex/template approach because AD document layouts are not standardized. They vary across issuing authorities, and even within EASA, the formatting shifts between revisions. Any hard-coded parser would need constant patching — it's a maintenance trap.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also considered a **full multimodal LLM approach** (sending the PDF directly to a vision-capable model), which would be simpler to implement. I opted against it for two reasons: multimodal inference is more expensive per request, and — more critically — vision models tend to underperform on small, dense text like MSN lists, modification numbers, and SB identifiers. These are exactly the fields where precision matters most in AD compliance. A missed serial number or a misread modification ID can lead to an incorrect applicability determination, which in aviation is not an acceptable margin of error.\n",
    "\n",
    "The OCR + LLM route gives me a layer of control between the document and the model. I can inspect, clean, and restructure the OCR output before the LLM ever sees it — something you simply cannot do when the model is reading the PDF as an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "The hardest part was not the LLM extraction itself — it was everything around the OCR output.\n",
    "\n",
    "**OCR post-processing** was the most time-consuming challenge. Raw PaddleOCR output is flat and unordered — it doesn't inherently understand that a block of text is a table header, or that two columns should be read left-to-right rather than top-to-bottom. I had to build post-processing logic to reconstruct reading order, merge fragmented text blocks, and normalize common OCR artifacts (misread characters in identifiers, inconsistent whitespace, broken line continuations). Getting this right was essential because garbage-in from OCR means garbage-out from the LLM, no matter how good the prompt is.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Schema design and evaluation** was another significant effort. I formulated the extraction output as a strict Pydantic schema (`ADApplicabilityExtraction`) with clearly separated fields for models, MSN constraints, modification constraints, SB constraints, aircraft groups, and required actions. The challenge was handling the many edge cases in AD language — \"all MSN except...\", \"whichever occurs first\", recurring vs. one-time compliance, terminating actions that cancel other paragraphs. Each of these required careful schema modeling and explicit extraction rules in the system prompt to prevent the LLM from conflating similar-but-distinct concepts (e.g., Airbus `mod` numbers vs. Service Bulletin identifiers — these look similar but have completely different compliance implications).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Building the deterministic applicability engine** required translating nuanced AD logic into boolean checks. The three-stage evaluation (model → MSN → modification/SB exclusion) sounds simple, but the devil is in the details: handling inclusive vs. exclusive range bounds, matching modification identifiers with regex while avoiding partial matches, and correctly implementing exclusion logic where an aircraft is initially in-scope but exempted by an already-embodied mod or SB.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several areas where this approach can fall short:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Layout-dependent information loss.** When OCR flattens a PDF into text, spatial relationships (table structures, column alignments, indentation hierarchies) are partially lost. For most AD paragraphs this is manageable, but for complex multi-column tables — like group definitions that map models to MSN ranges — the flattened text can be ambiguous. A multimodal model would handle these cases better since it can \"see\" the table structure visually.\n",
    "\n",
    "**LLM extraction is not deterministic.** Even with a strict schema and detailed prompt, the LLM can still occasionally misclassify a field, hallucinate a value, or miss a constraint. This is mitigated by the Pydantic validation layer (malformed output is rejected), but subtle errors — like placing a mod number in the SB field — can slip through if the prompt guardrails aren't specific enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "**GPU bottleneck in the current setup.** The OCR stage runs on a 4GB VRAM laptop GPU, which is a practical limitation. Processing speed is slower than it would be on a dedicated GPU with more CUDA cores — in production, this would need to be addressed with better hardware or a batched processing queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "**With more time, I would:**\n",
    "- Add a confidence scoring layer — have the LLM output confidence levels per extracted field, then flag low-confidence extractions for human review.\n",
    "- Build an automated evaluation pipeline that compares LLM extraction output against a ground-truth dataset of manually parsed ADs, measuring field-level precision and recall.\n",
    "- Experiment with a hybrid approach — use OCR + LLM as the primary path, but fall back to multimodal extraction for documents where OCR post-processing detects likely table structures that would benefit from visual understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Trade-offs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why LLM?** Because AD documents are written in natural language with enough variation that deterministic parsing (regex, template matching) is fragile. The LLM absorbs the ambiguity — it can handle paraphrased compliance language, varying section orderings, and inconsistent formatting without breaking. The trade-off is cost and non-determinism, but for this use case, the flexibility outweighs the risk, especially when paired with schema validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why OCR + text-only LLM over a full multimodal (VLM) approach?** Three reasons: cost, precision, and control. Text-only inference is cheaper. OCR engines are purpose-built for text recognition and outperform vision models on small/dense identifiers. And the OCR intermediate step gives me a post-processing hook — I can clean, validate, and restructure the text before the LLM processes it. With a VLM, the model is a black box between PDF-in and JSON-out; I have no opportunity to intervene when the document is messy.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, VLMs win on simplicity and layout understanding. If cost were not a constraint and the documents were consistently well-formatted, a multimodal approach would be a perfectly valid — and arguably simpler — choice. The right answer depends on the production context: how many ADs you're processing, how often, and how much tolerance you have for per-request cost vs. pipeline complexity."
