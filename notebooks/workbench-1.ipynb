    "- Extract only information explicitly stated in the document. Never infer or assume.\n",
    "- Preserve all identifiers verbatim (model names, SB numbers, mod numbers, MSNs).\n",
    "- If a field has no corresponding information in the document, set it to null.\n",
    "- Output valid JSON only. No markdown, no explanation, no commentary.\n",
    "\n",
    "CRITICAL DISTINCTIONS:\n",
    "- Airbus modification numbers (e.g. \"mod 24591\") → always go in modification_constraints. Never in sb_constraints.\n",
    "- Service Bulletin identifiers (e.g. \"A320-57-1089\") → always go in sb_constraints. Never in modification_constraints.\n",
    "- If the AD states \"all MSN\" or \"all manufacturer serial numbers\", always set MSNConstraint(all=True, excluded=False). Never leave msn_constraints null when MSN applicability is mentioned.\n",
    "- When multiple compliance limits use \"whichever occurs first\", list each as a separate ComplianceTime entry.\n",
    "- Recurring intervals (\"thereafter, at intervals not exceeding...\") → is_interval=True.\n",
    "- One-time thresholds (\"before exceeding...\") → is_interval=False.\n",

    "- Preserve all identifiers verbatim (model names, SB numbers, mod numbers, MSNs).\n",
    "- If a field has no corresponding information in the document, set it to null.\n",

    "CRITICAL DISTINCTIONS:\n",
    "- Airbus modification numbers (e.g. \"mod 24591\") → always go in modification_constraints. Never in sb_constraints.\n",
    "- Service Bulletin identifiers (e.g. \"A320-57-1089\") → always go in sb_constraints. Never in modification_constraints.\n",
    "- If the AD states \"all MSN\" or \"all manufacturer serial numbers\", always set MSNConstraint(all=True, excluded=False). Never leave msn_constraints null when MSN applicability is mentioned.\n",
    "- When multiple compliance limits use \"whichever occurs first\", list each as a separate ComplianceTime entry.\n",
